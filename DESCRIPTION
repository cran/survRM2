Depends: survival
Description: Performs two-sample comparisons using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) as a summary measure of the survival time distribution. Three kinds of between-group contrast metrics (i.e., the difference in RMST, the ratio of RMST and the ratio of the restricted mean time lost (RMTL)) are computed. It performs an ANCOVA-type covariate adjustment as well as unadjusted analyses for those measures.
